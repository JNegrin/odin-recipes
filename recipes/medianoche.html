    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island 
            of Cuba. This sandwich is best served with fried plantain chips 
            and a cold mamey milkshake!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sweet bread rolls </li>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup prepared mustard</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
            <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high 
                heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet 
                over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a 
                sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this 
                also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If 
                using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even 
                browning. Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>
            <li>Split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustard and 
                mayonnaise liberally onto the cut sides. On each sandwich, place 
                and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that 
                order. Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the 
                roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high 
                heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet 
                over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a 
                sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this 
                also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If 
                using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even 
                browning. Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>
